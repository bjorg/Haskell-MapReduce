-- | Functions to make test dictionaries and messages.  The key function
--   is 'makeWords' which take as arguments a tuple @(nWords,nVocab)@ where
--   @nWords@ is the desired number of words and @nVocab@ is the size of the
--   vocabulary.  The function uses as words randomly-generated strings of
--   upper-case letters  provided by 'makeWord': one could plug in a pre-existing
--   if that were felt necessary.
